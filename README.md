# FrontendNg

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.
This is my personal code repo for notes, not for real production code. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

For the server side rendering with express, refer to `https://angular.io/guide/universal#useful-scripts`, to run simply `npm run dev:ssr`

## Production server SSR

For production, we can run `node dist/server/main.js`, and user docker for deployment, as js app always exit when facing error.
